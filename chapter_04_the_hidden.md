# Chapter Four: The Hidden

**Alexandria, Egypt - March 413 CE (continued)**

Miriam bat David crouched in the cellar beneath Antoninus' warehouse, listening to footsteps above. Three days since the expulsion. Three days of hiding, moving from one temporary shelter to another, dependent on the mercy of Christians brave or foolish enough to risk Cyril's wrath.

The cellar was cramped and dark, lit by a single oil lamp. Around her, fifteen other Jews huddled—families who had missed the exodus, children too sick to travel, elderly who would die on the road. Refugees in their own city.

"They're gone," came Antoninus' voice from above. The merchant descended the stairs, his round face troubled. "Parabolani patrol. Third one today. They're searching warehouses in the commercial district."

"Looking for contraband?" asked Samuel, a scribe who had once employed twenty copyists. Now he had nothing but the clothes on his back and a Torah scroll he'd rescued from the flames.

"Looking for you," Antoninus said bluntly. "Cyril wants Alexandria completely cleansed. Any Jew still here is evidence of his incomplete authority."

"So we're leverage," Miriam said. "Proof that someone is defying him."

"Which makes sheltering you incredibly dangerous for me." Antoninus pulled out bread and dried fish, distributed them. "I'm not saying I want you to leave. I'm saying we need a better plan than hiding in my cellar indefinitely."

Miriam took her share gratefully. She hadn't eaten in a day. "Why are you doing this? You're Christian, successful, well-connected. You could just... ignore us."

"I could. Many do." Antoninus settled on a crate. "But I've lived in this city my entire life. My father traded with Jewish merchants. My first business partner was Jewish. I attended Hypatia's lectures alongside Jewish students. Alexandria was—" He caught himself. "Is—a place where different peoples live together. If that ends, if we become a city where only one faith, one voice, one way of thinking is permitted..." He shook his head. "That's not the Christianity Christ taught."

"Tell that to your bishop."

"Many have tried. He doesn't listen." Antoninus looked at Miriam. "You were Hypatia's student. Does she know you're still here?"

"No. I didn't want to endanger her."

"She might be able to help. She has influence, connections—"

"She's in danger herself," Miriam interrupted. "Everyone knows it. The Parabolani preachers mention her constantly. Calling her a witch, a demon-worshipper. If she's seen helping Jews, it gives Cyril exactly the excuse he needs."

A child whimpered in the darkness. His mother shushed him gently, rocking him despite her own exhaustion.

"We can't stay here," Samuel said quietly. "Antoninus, you've been generous beyond measure, but every day increases the risk. If they find us, they'll burn your warehouse. Maybe burn you with it."

"There's a ship," Miriam said suddenly. Everyone turned to her. "Three weeks from now. A grain ship heading to Constantinople. I heard dock workers talking about it yesterday when I was..." She hesitated. "When I was begging."

The shame in her voice cut through the cellar. Miriam bat David had been a scholar, one of the few women allowed to study advanced mathematics. She had worked on astronomical calculations with Hypatia herself, had corresponded with philosophers across the Empire. Now she begged for crusts.

"A ship," Samuel repeated. "Can we afford passage?"

"Probably not. But we might be able to hide in the hold. I know some of the dock workers—they're not all Cyril's fanatics."

"That's three weeks," Antoninus said. "Three weeks of hiding, of not being discovered. And even if you make it aboard, the journey to Constantinople takes a month in good weather. Cramped in a hold, no light, limited food and water..."

"It's still better than what we have now," Miriam said.

A commotion upstairs—shouting, the sound of crates being overturned. Antoninus' face went pale.

"They're searching the warehouse. Everyone, stay absolutely silent."

He hurried up the stairs. Miriam heard his voice, forced cheerful: "Gentlemen! What can I do for you?"

"We're conducting inspections," came an unfamiliar voice. "Bishop Cyril's orders. Looking for contraband and... undesirables."

"Feel free to look around. As you can see, just grain and olive oil. Nothing contraband about that."

"Unless you're hiding Jews. The bishop was very clear—anyone sheltering Jews is committing a crime against the church."

"I'm a loyal Christian. You can check my attendance records at the Church of Theonas. I was baptized twenty years ago by—"

"We're not questioning your faith. We're questioning your business practices."

Footsteps above, moving through the warehouse. In the cellar, fifteen people held their breath. The child started to cry, and his mother clamped her hand over his mouth, tears streaming down her face.

Miriam's heart hammered. If they were discovered, what would happen? Arrest? Immediate execution? Would Antoninus be implicated?

The footsteps moved closer to the cellar door.

"What's down there?" the Parabolani asked.

"Storage. Old amphoras, mostly. Nothing of interest."

"We'll be the judge of that."

The cellar door creaked open. Light spilled down the stairs. Miriam pressed herself against the wall, knowing it was futile. There was nowhere to hide, no excuse that would save them.

A shadow appeared in the doorway.

Then: "Brother Philip! Over here!"

The voice came from across the warehouse. The shadow at the cellar door hesitated, then withdrew. "What is it?"

"Found something. Looks like pagan texts. Hidden behind these grain sacks."

The footsteps moved away. After an eternal moment, Miriam heard Antoninus speaking again: "Those? Old accounting ledgers. Written in Greek, which I suppose might look pagan if you don't read—"

"I read Greek perfectly well," the Parabolani said coldly. "These are heretical philosophical works. Plotinus. Porphyry. Iamblichus. Why do you have these?"

"They were my grandfather's. I kept them for sentimental—"

"Sentiment for paganism is suspicious, merchant. Especially combined with your attendance at the witch's lectures."

"Hypatia is not a witch. She's a respected philosopher and mathematician."

"She's a demon in woman's form, and anyone who defends her is suspect." A pause. "We'll be watching you, Antoninus. Very closely. And we'll be back to search more thoroughly."

After they left, Antoninus descended to the cellar, his hands shaking.

"That was too close. We need to move you tonight."

"Move us where?" Samuel asked. "Every building in Alexandria is watched."

"Not every building." Antoninus took a deep breath. "There's a place. It's... complicated. And dangerous. But it might be the safest option."

"Tell us."

"The ruins of the Serapeum."

Silence. The Serapeum—once the magnificent temple complex dedicated to Serapis, home to one of Alexandria's great libraries. Destroyed by Theophilus twenty-two years ago, now a scorched monument to Christian triumph. No one went there except occasionally Christian priests to gloat over its destruction.

"You want us to hide in a ruined temple," Samuel said slowly. "A pagan temple destroyed by Christians. As Jews."

"I know how it sounds. But think about it—no one goes there. It's been stripped of anything valuable. The Parabolani consider it cleansed, a victory already won. They won't search it because they don't need to. Meanwhile, parts of the underground structure are intact. Storage chambers, aqueduct tunnels. You could hide there for weeks."

"Or be trapped there," Miriam pointed out.

"Yes. That's the risk. But right now, I can't protect you here. Not with them watching me. Not with another search coming." He looked around at the exhausted, frightened faces. "I'm sorry. I wish I could do more."

That night, Miriam led the group through Alexandria's back streets toward the Serapeum. Antoninus had provided dark cloaks, a map of the ruins, and supplies for a week. It wasn't enough, but it was everything he could manage.

The city at night was a different creature. In daylight, Alexandria maintained a veneer of civilization—markets functioned, ships unloaded, people went about their business. But after dark, the true power structure emerged. Parabolani patrols moved in packs, looking for violations of curfew, signs of paganism, anyone who seemed suspicious.

They moved in silence, keeping to shadows, pausing whenever they heard footsteps or voices. Miriam led them through routes she'd learned from two weeks of hiding—alleys too narrow for patrols, courtyards with broken walls, the underbelly of the city that existed beneath official notice.

As they passed near the waterfront, Miriam paused. In the distance, she could see Hypatia's home—a modest villa near the Museum complex. Lights burned in the upper windows. Her teacher was awake, probably working on calculations or preparing tomorrow's lecture.

But something else caught her attention: three figures in dark robes standing across from Hypatia's villa, watching. Parabolani. Even at this hour, they were monitoring her teacher's movements.

Miriam felt ice in her stomach. The surveillance had begun. What had happened to the Jews—expulsion, persecution, erasure—was coming for Hypatia too. The pattern was unmistakable.

She wanted to run to the villa, to warn her teacher, to beg her to flee while she still could. Hypatia had always been kind to her, had encouraged her mathematical studies when others said women couldn't understand advanced geometry. She had treated Miriam's Jewishness as irrelevant, caring only about the quality of her thinking.

But going to Hypatia now would endanger them both. And the warning would be futile—everyone who knew Hypatia knew she wouldn't run. Better to disappear, to become another name on the list of expelled Jews, forgotten by history. At least then she might survive to remember what came next.

"Miriam," Samuel whispered urgently, pulling at her arm. "Those Parabolani—if they see us—"

She tore herself away, memorizing the image: Hypatia's lit window, the watching shadows, the inevitable pattern unfolding. She would carry this memory to Constantinople, this knowledge of how the beast had stalked its prey.

And when it was over—when they heard what had been done—she would at least understand that it hadn't been sudden. It had been deliberate, methodical, inevitable.

They led them onward into the darkness.

The Serapeum sat on the city's outskirts, built on an artificial hill that had once made it visible from across Alexandria. Now it was a blackened scar, its columns toppled, its statues smashed, its library chambers gutted by fire.

Miriam had been here once with her father, years before the destruction. She remembered towering Corinthian columns, elaborate mosaics, the smell of incense and old papyrus. The library had been smaller than the great Royal Library but still magnificent—forty thousand scrolls, carefully catalogued, maintained by devoted priests.

Now it was rubble.

They picked their way through the ruins, searching for the entrance to the underground chambers. Moonlight cast strange shadows through the broken columns, making the destruction seem almost deliberate in its artistry.

"There," Samuel said, pointing to a partially collapsed stairway. "That should lead down."

They descended carefully. The stairs were unstable, cracked by fire and time. At the bottom, they found themselves in what had once been a storage chamber. The ceiling was scorched but intact, held up by pillars carved with hieroglyphs—ancient Egyptian writing that predated the Greek overlay.

"This will do," Samuel said. "It's dry, hidden, and large enough for all of us."

They settled in, arranging their meager possessions, trying to make the cold stone floor more comfortable. Children whimpered until their parents told them stories—old tales of exile and return, of persecution survived, of faith maintained despite everything.

Miriam sat apart, her back against a hieroglyphic pillar. In the lamplight, she could make out images of Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. The Romans had identified him with their Mercury, the Greeks with their Hermes. The same deity, worshipped under different names by different peoples.

All of them destroyed now. Thoth and Mercury and Hermes, swept away by the same force that had destroyed this temple, expelled her people, threatened her teacher.

She thought about what Hypatia had taught her: that truth was independent of the person speaking it. That mathematics worked the same whether calculated by Egyptian priests, Greek philosophers, or Jewish scholars. That the cosmos followed laws more ancient and more enduring than any human religion.

But what good was truth if no one was left to speak it? What use was mathematics if the mathematicians were all dead or scattered?

"You're thinking loud thoughts," Samuel said, settling beside her. "I can hear them from across the chamber."

"Just wondering if this is what becomes of us. Hiding in ruins, waiting for ships that may never come, preserving knowledge that no one wants preserved."

"The Torah says God tested Abraham, Moses, Job. That the righteous are refined like gold in fire."

"I'm tired of being refined. I'd rather be left alone to study and teach and live."

"Wouldn't we all." Samuel looked around the ruined chamber. "But history has other plans. It always does."

They sat in silence, listening to the settling of ancient stones and the whispered prayers of the fearful.

Above them, Alexandria slept—or pretended to. In the Patriarchal Palace, Cyril was praying. In the Prefect's residence, Orestes was planning. In her villa, Hypatia was calculating the precession of equinoxes, mapping the slow wobble of the earth's axis, a phenomenon that took 26,000 years to complete its cycle.

Empires rose and fell in that time. Religions were born and died. Cities flourished and crumbled. But the math remained constant, indifferent to human drama.

Miriam pulled out a small scroll she'd salvaged—not Torah, but mathematics. Euclid's Elements, the geometric proofs that had survived a thousand years and would survive a thousand more if anyone bothered to preserve them.

She read by lamplight, losing herself in the elegant logic of theorems and axioms. For a brief moment, she forgot she was a refugee hiding in a ruined temple. She was simply a student again, following the beautiful trail of logic from premise to conclusion, from question to proof.

This, she thought, is what they cannot destroy. They can burn libraries, smash statues, scatter peoples. But they cannot erase the fact that a right triangle's sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. They cannot make geometric truth false by declaring it heretical.

Truth persists. Knowledge endures.

Or so she desperately wanted to believe.

Outside the ruins, a Parabolani patrol passed by, their torches casting flickering light through the broken columns. They paused, and Miriam held her breath.

Then one of them laughed. "Fitting, isn't it? The pagan temple is now home to demons and rats."

"The Bishop wants us to demolish what's left. Grind it down to nothing."

"Good. Let no stone remain upon stone. Let nothing of the old world survive."

Their voices faded as they moved on.

Miriam looked down at her scroll, at Euclid's perfect proofs.

Let nothing of the old world survive.

But it would. It had to.

Because if it didn't—if all the accumulated knowledge of centuries could be erased in a generation—then what was the point of civilization at all?

She rolled up the scroll carefully, protecting it from the damp, and settled down to sleep.

Tomorrow she would talk to the dock workers about that ship to Constantinople.

Tomorrow she would try to survive one more day.

Tomorrow.

Always tomorrow.
