# Chapter Two: The Bishop

**Alexandria, Egypt - October 412 CE**

The Jewish merchant trembled before Bishop Cyril's desk. His name was Isaac, and he had made the mistake of complaining publicly about the new taxes levied on synagogues.

"You say the taxes are unfair," Cyril said mildly, not looking up from the document he was reviewing. "That the church demands too much from your community."

"Your Grace, I simply said—"

"You said that Christian rule is more oppressive than pagan rule ever was. That under Theophilus you paid less. That my uncle, at least, was predictable." Now Cyril looked up, his eyes cold. "Did you think no one would report this to me?"

Isaac's face went pale. "I spoke in anger. I meant no disrespect to the church or to—"

"To me?" Cyril stood, came around the desk. "You see, Isaac, this is the problem. You and your people think you can say whatever you wish, worship however you please, exist in this city as if you have some inherent right to be here. But rights come from authority, and authority flows from God through His church. Through me."

"We pay our taxes. We follow Roman law. We—"

"Roman law." Cyril smiled thinly. "Yes. We'll see how long that protects you." He nodded to Peter the Reader, standing silently by the door. "Escort Merchant Isaac out. Make sure he understands that his next public complaint will have... consequences."

After Isaac fled, Cyril returned to his desk, his hands perfectly steady. This was necessary work. Not pleasant, perhaps, but necessary. The Jewish community needed to understand their place in Christian Alexandria.

The Patriarchal Palace stood adjacent to the Church of Theonas, a sprawling complex of buildings that had grown more fortress than sanctuary. Later that evening, in its main hall beneath a gold-leaf mosaic of Christ Pantocrator whose stern gaze seemed to follow all who entered, Cyril knelt in prayer. His forty-year-old frame was lean from fasting, his face angular and intense, eyes burning with the fervor of absolute conviction.

"Lord," he whispered, his breath misting in the cool morning air, "make me an instrument of Your will. Give me the strength to cleanse this city of pollution, to drive out the demons of pagan learning, to make Alexandria a beacon of Christian truth in a world still shrouded in darkness."

Behind him, he heard the soft footfall of Peter the Reader, his most devoted lector. Peter was younger, perhaps twenty-eight, with the rawboned build of a man who had known hunger before the church fed him. He had the zeal of the convert, having abandoned a family of pagan philosophers to embrace Christ—and never forgave himself for the years he spent in what he now considered demonic bondage.

"Your Grace," Peter said, his voice hoarse. "The Parabolani have gathered as you commanded. They await your word."

Cyril rose, his knees protesting slightly. He had been praying since before dawn, as was his custom. "Good. And the matter of the Jewish quarter?"

"The complaints have been documented. The Jews mock our holy processions, they blaspheme against Christ in their synagogues, they lend money at rates that impoverish good Christians—"

"Enough." Cyril held up his hand. "I don't need a list of their sins, Peter. I need legal justification for action."

"But Your Grace, if we act with God's authority—"

"God's authority must work through earthly channels when possible. My uncle taught me that." Cyril moved to the window overlooking the courtyard, where five hundred Parabolani had assembled. Originally founded as hospital workers—their name meant "the reckless ones," those willing to risk infection to care for the sick—they had become something else under his guidance. They were the church militant, ready to defend Christian Alexandria against all enemies, visible and invisible.

The mention of his uncle brought a familiar mixture of pride and inadequacy. Theophilus had been Patriarch for twenty-eight years, a giant of a man in every sense. He had destroyed the Serapeum, crushed the Origenist heresy, made Alexandria's church the rival of Rome itself in power and influence. When he died six months ago, Cyril had fought viciously for the succession, bribing officials, making promises, calling in favors. His rival had been Timothy the Archdeacon, backed by the moderates who thought Theophilus had gone too far.

Cyril had won. And now he would prove himself worthy of his uncle's legacy by finishing what Theophilus had begun—the total Christianization of Alexandria.

"The problem," Cyril said, turning back to Peter, "is that the Jews have legal standing in this city. They've been here since before Christ walked the earth. Roman law protects them. If I simply expel them without cause, Prefect Orestes will have grounds to report me to Constantinople."

"Orestes," Peter spat the name. "A Christian who protects pagans and Jews. He's worse than an infidel—he's a traitor to the faith."

"Careful," Cyril said sharply. "Orestes was baptized in Constantinople by the Archbishop himself. We cannot question his Christianity without questioning the validity of his baptism, which would create theological complications we don't need. No, Orestes is simply... confused about the relationship between civil and ecclesiastical authority. He still thinks Rome governs Alexandria. He doesn't understand that God does, through His church."

"Through you, Your Grace."

Cyril smiled slightly. "Through me."

A servant entered, bowing low. "Your Grace, Bishop Synesius of Ptolemais has arrived. He says it's urgent."

Cyril frowned. Synesius was a problem—a student of that woman Hypatia, yet also a Christian bishop. An impossibility, a walking contradiction. That such men could exist proved how polluted Christianity had become with pagan philosophy.

"Send him in. Peter, stay. I want a witness."

Synesius entered leaning on a walking stick, his illness evident in his pale skin and labored breathing. At thirty-nine, he looked a decade older. But his eyes were still sharp, still carrying that mixture of intellectual pride and spiritual struggle that marked all Hypatia's students.

"Cyril," he said, not using the title. A deliberate slight.

"Bishop Synesius," Cyril replied, emphasizing the rank. "You look unwell. Perhaps you should be resting."

"I'll rest soon enough. God is calling me home." Synesius lowered himself carefully into a chair. "I'm here about the rumors. That you plan to move against the Jewish population."

"Rumors are like Alexandria's winds—constant and unreliable."

"Don't play games with me. We studied rhetoric together, remember? Before you decided philosophy was demonic." Synesius coughed, a wet sound that made Peter step back instinctively. "The Jews have done nothing to warrant expulsion."

"They blaspheme against Christ daily."

"So do the pagans, and you tolerate them."

"For now." Cyril sat across from Synesius, steepling his fingers. "The pagans are dying on their own. Every year, fewer worship at their shrines, fewer teach their philosophies. Time will solve the pagan problem. But the Jews are different—they're organized, wealthy, influential. Their refusal to accept Christ is an active wound in the city's body."

"Listen to yourself," Synesius said. "This isn't theology. This is politics dressed in holy garments."

"All theology is politics. All politics is theology. They cannot be separated, though fools like Prefect Orestes try." Cyril leaned forward. "Tell me, Synesius, how do you reconcile it? Your beloved teacher Hypatia—a pagan who denies Christ—with your vows as a Christian bishop?"

Synesius met his gaze steadily. "Hypatia taught me to think. Christ taught me what to think about. One does not contradict the other."

"Heresy," Peter breathed.

"Nuance," Synesius corrected. "Something your acolyte here wouldn't recognize if it bit him."

"Careful," Cyril warned. "Peter is devoted to the faith in ways you have never been."

"Peter is devoted to violence in ways I pray I will never be." Synesius struggled to his feet. "I came to warn you, Cyril. If you move against the Jews, Orestes will oppose you. And if you push him too hard, he will call for imperial intervention. Is that what you want? Soldiers from Constantinople investigating your activities?"

"Let them come. They'll find a bishop defending his flock against those who murdered Christ."

"Christ was killed by Romans, not Jews."

"The Jews demanded it. Pontius Pilate washed his hands—"

"Is this really the argument we're having?" Synesius laughed bitterly, then coughed again. "Fine. Believe your simple narrative if you must. But mark my words—if you start down this path, you won't be able to control where it ends. Violence has its own logic."

"I control the Parabolani absolutely."

"No man controls a mob. You can aim it, perhaps, but once it begins to move..." Synesius shook his head. "I'm dying, Cyril. I'll be gone within a year. But Hypatia—she's in danger, isn't she? That's what this is really about. The Jews are practice. You're building momentum for something larger."

The silence stretched. Peter watched his bishop, waiting for the denial. But Cyril said nothing.

"God forgive you," Synesius whispered finally. "Because history won't."

After he left, Peter burst out: "Your Grace, he threatens you openly! He should be—"

"He'll be dead soon enough," Cyril said calmly. "The illness will do what we don't need to. Synesius is irrelevant." He moved to a table covered with scrolls and documents. "But he's right about one thing—we need to build momentum. The Jews first. They're unpopular enough that expelling them will be celebrated by the Christian masses. Once the people see that I can act decisively, that Orestes is powerless to stop me, then..."

"Then the pagan woman."

"Then the symbol she represents." Cyril picked up a scroll—a report on Hypatia's activities, compiled by informants who attended her lectures. "Do you know what she teaches, Peter? That truth exists independent of revelation. That reason can discover what faith claims to reveal. That a woman—a *woman*—can understand the cosmos as well as any man. It's not just paganism. It's an alternative to everything the church represents."

"She's a witch," Peter said flatly. "Everyone knows it. Those instruments she builds—they commune with demons. The stars she reads—they're angels fallen with Lucifer."

Cyril almost laughed. Peter's theology was crude, superstitious, the kind of belief that educated Christians found embarrassing. But crude theology was dangerous theology, easy to mobilize, simple to inflame. Nuance and complexity were for scholars. The mob needed clear enemies and simple truths.

"Perhaps," Cyril said carefully. "But we must be patient. Orestes protects her. Some say..." He paused, as if the words were distasteful. "Some say more than politically."

Peter's eyes widened. "He fornicate with her?"

"I said nothing of the sort. But he consults with her, visits her, takes her advice on matters of governance. For a Christian prefect to prefer the counsel of a pagan philosopher over his own bishop—it's an insult to God Himself."

"Then why does God permit it?"

"God tests us," Cyril said. "He allows evil to flourish so that the righteous might prove their worth in opposing it. Job was tested. Abraham was tested. Now we are tested."

He moved to the window again, watching the Parabolani below. Five hundred strong now, growing every month. Men who had nothing before the church gave them purpose. Women like Helena, rescued from prostitution and given dignity through service. They loved him with the fervor of the saved, would do anything he commanded.

"The Jewish expulsion will happen next week," Cyril said. "During their festival of Purim. The irony will not be lost—they celebrate escaping genocide in Persia only to face expulsion in Alexandria."

"Your uncle would be proud," Peter said.

"My uncle would have done it three years ago," Cyril replied. "I've been too patient, too diplomatic. Trying to work with Orestes, trying to find accommodation. But some men cannot be reasoned with. Some situations require not discussion but decision." He turned to Peter. "When the time comes—and it will come soon—I will need men who don't hesitate. Who don't question. Who act."

"I am such a man, Your Grace."

"I know you are, Peter. That's why you're here."

Later, after Peter left to brief the Parabolani on the Jewish expulsion, Cyril stood alone in the hall beneath the golden Christ. The mosaic was exquisite work, created by the finest artisans, paid for with money that had once decorated pagan temples. 

Theophilus had taught him that. Don't just defeat your enemies—recycle them. The gold that once adorned statues of Serapis now glorified Christ. The philosophers who once taught Plato now taught scripture. The buildings that housed pagan learning became Christian churches.

And when there was nothing left to recycle, when the old world had been completely absorbed and digested, then the new world could truly begin.

He thought of Hypatia, standing in her lecture hall, teaching mathematics and astronomy as if these were neutral subjects, as if knowledge existed independent of God's will. She didn't understand that all knowledge was either submission to divine truth or rebellion against it. There was no middle ground, no neutral space.

Her father, Theon, had understood this better. He had watched the Serapeum burn and known his world was ending. He had grown old and died broken, watching helplessly as everything he valued turned to ash.

The daughter was different. She thought she could preserve the old learning by teaching it to Christians and pagans alike, building bridges between worlds that God intended to separate. It was foolish and dangerous in equal measure.

But it was also compelling, he had to admit. Even Cyril, who despised everything she represented, occasionally wondered what it would be like to attend one of her lectures, to hear her explain the movements of the planets or the properties of numbers. Not to believe, of course—that would be impossible. But to understand why so many found her words more compelling than scripture.

No. That way lay compromise, and compromise was what had allowed paganism to persist for so long. Theophilus had understood that. You don't debate the enemy; you destroy them. You don't engage with their ideas; you erase them.

A servant entered with a message from the palace kitchens—the evening meal was ready. Cyril waved him away. He would fast again tonight, as he had fasted three nights this week. The body's hunger focused the mind's purpose.

He knelt again before the mosaic, letting the golden Christ fill his vision.

"Make me Your hammer," he prayed. "Make me Your sword. I will not flinch from what must be done. Show me the way, Lord, and I will walk it, though all the world calls me monster. For Your glory, for Your church, for Your truth alone."

The golden eyes stared down at him, revealing nothing, judging everything.

In the courtyard below, the Parabolani were chanting psalms, their voices rising like the smoke of sacrifice.

And in the city beyond, a Jewish family was celebrating Purim, lighting candles, telling the story of Esther who had saved her people from annihilation.

They had three days left.

Cyril rose from prayer and went to write the expulsion order.

The pen moved across the parchment with absolute confidence, each letter a small act of violence, each word a step toward the world he envisioned—pure, Christian, unified under the authority of the church.

Outside, the sun set over Alexandria. The Pharos lighthouse blazed to life, its great fire reflecting off the harbor waters.

In the gathering darkness, the city looked almost peaceful. Almost holy.

Almost worth saving.

Almost.
